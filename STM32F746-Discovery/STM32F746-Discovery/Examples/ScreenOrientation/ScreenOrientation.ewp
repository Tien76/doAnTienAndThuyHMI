// Welcome to the example 'ScreenOrientation'!
//
// The intention of this project is to show the possibility to create a GUI application \
// that is independent from the physical layout of the LCD.
//
// This means, you can create a GUI application in portrait mode for a target that \
// is connected with a LCD in landscape mode (or the other way). Or you can run your \
// GUI application using a display that is mounted with a rotation by 180 degrees.
// The Code Generator of Embedded Wizard and the Graphics Engine running on the target \
// will take care, that everything appears in the proper orientation.
//
// Within the Profile settings of a project you can choose one of the following ScreenOrientations:
// Normal, Rotated_90, Rotated_180 or Rotated_270
//
// To generate code for the target, select the desired profile within the drop-down \
// box and press 'F8'.
